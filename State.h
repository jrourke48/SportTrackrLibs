/**
 * @file State.h
 * @brief Table-driven state descriptor with execution behavior.
 *
 * A State is defined by:
 *  - a small integer ID
 *  - a const char* name (for debugging)
 *  - an execute function that implements the state's behavior and may
 *    return the next state ID to transition to
 *
 * The FSM is execute-driven: it calls the current state's execute() and
 * honors any returned next-state ID to perform forced transitions.
